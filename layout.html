      <p>A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar 
      hitch hiker can have. Partly it has great practical value — you can wrap it 
      around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; 
      you can lie on it on the brilliant marble‐sanded beaches of Santraginus V,
      inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which 
      shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini raft 
      down the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in hand‐to‐hand‐combat; wrap 
      it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the 
      Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mindbogglingly stupid animal, it assumes 
      that if you can't see it, it can't see you — daft as a bush, but very ravenous); 
      you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry 
      yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.</p>
    
      <p>More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason, 
      if a strag (strag: nonhitchhiker) discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel 
      with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a 
      toothbrush, washcloth, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, 
      gnat spray, wet-weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will 
      then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or a dozen other items that the 
      hitchhiker might have accidentally "lost.". What the strag will think is that any 
      man that can hitch the length and breadth of the Galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle 
      against terrible odds, win through and still know where his towel is, is clearly 
      a man to be reckoned with.</p>
